The great powers of Terraria can provide the player some very cool weapons. However, these items' true potential are locked to any but the most worthy, destined by name to get cool visual effects when using them. To unlock these powers, you must be destined from the start or prepared change the very core of your being.
That being said, the Empress of Light and Moon Lord aren't lawyers; they won't mind a little trickery, will they?

Adds the Forged Developer Signature, a way to use the special dev-only colors of many weapons (Last Prism, Starlight, Eventide, Nightglow, Terraprisma) without changing your name.
Simply... "get creative" with any sort of legal document (Pet Licenses + Black Ink @ Tinkerer's Workshop) and the colors will be yours.
